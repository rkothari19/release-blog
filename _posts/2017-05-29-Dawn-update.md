As we explained in the [post on the Hacks blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/04/simplifying-firefox-release-channels/) and on [this blog](http://release.mozilla.org/firefox/release/2017/04/17/Dawn-Project-FAQ.html), we have been working at changing the release mechanism of Firefox.

We are now ready to migrate the aurora population for Firefox Desktop and Android.

# Desktop

The aurora population will be migrated to the beta channel. Users will keep the Developer Edition branding and specifities. Updates are now being proposed to users.
Current developer edition instance of Firefox will be automatically updated within a few days. Users can also trigger an update by opening the About window of Firefox.
From the technical perspective, we are rebuilding the regular beta builds to generate the beta developer edition version. They are built from the same code.


# Android

In parallel, the current aurora population on Google Play will be upgraded to Nightly.
The Android application will keep the same application name (org.mozilla.fennec_aurora) while
providing Firefox for Android nightly.
This will help detecting Android specific issues earlier in the cycle and mitigating the impact to users.
